# Dropout in Neural Network

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script for building a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify the Iris flower dataset. The model includes dropout layers to enhance generalization and prevent overfitting.

## Dropout

The dropout layer is implemented to prevent overfitting. It randomly drops a specified percentage of neurons during training, forcing the network to learn more robust features.
